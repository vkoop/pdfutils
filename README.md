# PDF Utils
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vkoop/pdfutils.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vkoop/pdfutils)

Cli tool to concat and merge pdf files.

## Why?
Because pdftk isn't included in recent versions of ubuntu anymore.  Therefore I needed an alternative cmd tool to merge / concat pdf files.

## Create executable

Create a zipped version of the exectuable files.
``` bash
./gradlew distZip
```

The zip is placed in the folder "build/distributions".
